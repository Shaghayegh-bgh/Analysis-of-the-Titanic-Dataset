# Analysis-of-the-Titanic-Dataset

This project demonstrates data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The main steps include:

1. Data Cleaning

Removing irrelevant columns

Encoding categorical variables

Handling missing values

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations: Created various plots (histograms, boxplots, etc.) to explore distributions and patterns.

Covariance matrix: Computed and visualized to understand relationships between variables.

Correlation analysis: Investigated and interpreted correlations among features to identify key relationships.

### This code provides a clear workflow from raw data cleaning to insightful data analysis, useful for understanding dataset characteristics and variable relationships.
